Hey there! I'm Robert Lewis, a passionate self-taught full-stack developer and UCLA graduate in Statistics and Data Science.

I specialize in Web Development (React, Next.js, Node.js),  Data Engineering (Apache Spark, AWS), and Data Science (Python, R, TensorFlow).

Recently, I've been focusing on cyber security to help organizations fortify their defenses against evolving cyber threats.

Outside of programming, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new restaurants in Los Angeles. If you happen to be in the same city, maybe we can grab a bite or code together.

If you share my passion for building a safer digital landscape, let's connect and discuss how we can work together to make a positive impact!
