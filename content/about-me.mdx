Hi there! I'm **Robert Lewis**, a {age}-year-old **self-taught full-stack developer** and **UCLA graduate in Statistics and Data Science**, currently based in the vibrant city of Los Angeles, California. With a burning passion for technology and its transformative potential, I've immersed myself in a wide array of cutting-edge tools and frameworks.

My expertise encompasses front-end technologies like [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), back-end frameworks such as [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com), and mobile development using [React-native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/). I primarily code in [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), with a strong emphasis on [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for enhanced type safety and maintainability, and [Python](https://www.python.org/) for its versatility and extensive library support.

Recently, I've shifted my focus to the critical field of cyber security, driven by a desire to safeguard digital assets and create secure systems in an increasingly connected world. I'm excited to apply my diverse skill set, which includes data engineering with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), leveraging cloud platforms like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and utilizing data science libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), to tackle the complex challenges in this domain.

I'm always eager to collaborate and explore new opportunities in the cyber security space, where I can contribute my skills and knowledge to help organizations fortify their defenses against evolving cyber threats. If you share my passion for building a safer digital landscape, let's connect and discuss how we can work together to make a positive impact!
