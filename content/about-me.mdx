Hey there! I'm Robert Lewis, a passionate self-taught full-stack developer and UCLA graduate in Statistics and Data Science.

I specialize in data engineering (Python, SQL, Apache Spark, AWS), data science (Python, R, machine learning), and full-stack web development (React, Node.js, Django), with experience in data analysis, visualization, and ML model deployment, along with a self-taught background in front-end and back-end technologies.

Outside of programming, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new restaurants in Los Angeles. If you happen to be in the same city, maybe we can grab a bite or code together.

If you share my passion for building a safer digital landscape, let's connect and discuss how we can work together to make a positive impact!
